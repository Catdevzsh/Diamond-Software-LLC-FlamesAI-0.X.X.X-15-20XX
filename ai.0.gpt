The A.I. should only capable of pulling assets from Super Mario 64, unable to create assets of its own. This can include bringing back assets that are functional yet go unused, such as Blargg or the Dancing Flower effect. A prime example of this and one that spurred alot of the conversation about personalisation is the 1-up hidden in Whomp's Fortress. Many recall there being a visible indicator, such as a cracked wall texture, to show the player that the 1-up is there. Alas, in the prime circulated ROM there is no indicator leaving many to not know of the obscure secret.

The A.I. can also change assets of levels. This falls under the concept of Dynamic Level Rearrangement, where the A.I. will change elements of the level to reflect a change in theming or difficulty. At its most simple, it'll merely change and modify textures and object placement. At its most complex however, it can change the very missions that the player must go through, or even change the arrangement of instruments in the music to create whole new tracks.
Strangely, the A.I. appears to be able to pull from beta content too. Most instances of the A.I.'s happenings usually features some version of the original beta heads-up display that was shown within the game's promotional material, even though very little of this original font exists within the retail release of the game.  This verison has been watered down to be safe. 13+ for youtube so the Wario mod is removed. by ARG INC
Benevolent A.I. Theory
While many consider the A.I. to be an insidious abomination of human creation, it's also possible that the personalisation algorithms were made to ensure that Super Mario 64 was a fun and memorable game that changed every time one played it. It is possible that manifestations of more anomalous phenomena are a misguided attempt to create new experiences for every playthrough. This would be in line with Nintendo's business model of trying to create games that are fun and replayable.
